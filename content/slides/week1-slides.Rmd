# Breakout rooms!

Starting with whomever had a snack or meal most recently, discuss . . . 

1. What is something you're good at but don't particularly like to do?
1. What is something you like to do but aren't particularly good at?
1. Why are you interested in data science?

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q: Why not language X?**  
A: We can discuss that over coffee.

# What we learned from your survey responses (thank you!)

- Everyone uses spreadsheet software
- You're (mostly) confident that you can solve problems with respect to analyzing 
data, but are less confident with respect to using statistical software
- You have impressive backgrounds and professional experiences
- For many, programming and using statistics correctly can be intimidating
- You're a bit more interested in preparing data for analyses than we thought (cool!)

---

# Pedagogical framework

*Constructivist*

You'll be involved in the process of building new capabilities (and knowledge and skills) with support from others and carefully-chosen scaffolds.

1. You will be doing a great deal of the work
1. Then, we will discuss what we did and how it applies

---

# Over-arching design

The pedagogical framework *plays out* in the following specific ways:

1. You'll first see some brief examples to give you a sense of what's possible
1. You'll be using R Markdown to try things out
1. You'll have a chance to share your ideas and thoughts about what you've done; it will also give me a chance to hear from you about what you did

---

# A little motivation theory

## Expectancy-value theory

- We choose things that we are *confident* that we can do well and that are *valuable* to us

- We do these in a sociocultural *context*: our sense of belonging impacts what we choose to do

---

# An argument for this class

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use R and RStudio to solve
problems that are important to you**

- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education**

---

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is increasingly used in education
* It can help you to carry out your educational analyses in open and trustworthy ways
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

---

# RMarkdown

* RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
* It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
* It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)

# Let's look at a bit of code together

What do you think this code will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sci_mo_processed %>% 
  filter(percentage_earned >= .60) %>% 
  select(student_id, course_id, percentage_earned))
```
