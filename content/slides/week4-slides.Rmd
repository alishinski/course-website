# Welcome!

Welcome to *week 4*!

**Record the meeting** 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```

# Discussion!

**Two questions**

- What is one particular "messy data" problem have you encountered (or do you anticipate encountering) in your own work?
- What is an example of multiple, separate datasets that you might wish to combine together into a single dataset in your work? If you cannot immediately think of one, consider information that might be recorded or created in two different files, but which could be useful to combine.

(10 minutes)

### Review of last week's class

**Last week we discussed wrangling and tidying data**:

1. Reading in Data
1. Tidying data
1. Our tidy data tools

---

### Homework

**Effective and ineffective ways of filtering the data**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  filter(content == 1, content == 2, content == 3, content == 4, content == 5)
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  filter(content == "1", content == "2", content == "3", content == "4", content == "5")
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  filter(content == "1" | content == "2" | content == "3" | content == "4" | content == "5")
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% filter(between(content, 1, 5))
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% filter(content %in% c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"))
```

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data %>% filter(str_detect(content, "[1-5]"))
```

---

## Reminder

Check the output of functions you write carefully; you may find yourself *constantly* looking at and viewing your data!

**How do I check/view my data?** 

There are many ways:

- `my_data` (just typing the name of your data will print info about it!)
- `glance(my_data)`
- `str(my_data)`
- `View(my_data)` (do not include in `.Rmd` document)
- `skimr::skim(my_data)` (must install "skimr" first) 
- `psych::describe()` (must install "psych" first)

### This week's topics

**Overview**

1. Tidy data: Data reshaping
1. Working with multiple data frames: joins
1. Grouped data operations with dplyr

We are by no means done with the data tidying tools we discussed last week, so don't feel like you should already have those completely mastered yet.

---

### 1. Data reshaping

**Outline**

What is reshaping?

Why would you reshape?

How do you reshape?

---

### 1. Data reshaping

** What is reshaping? **

* Reshaping involves moving data between "long"er and "wide"er formats

  + Wide data has more columns and fewer rows

  + Long data has more rows and fewer columns

  + This is often a choice you can make with your data

---

### 1. Data reshaping

** What is reshaping? **

* Reshaping involves moving data between "long"er and "wide"er formats

```{r, out.width = "65%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/original-dfs-tidy.png")
```

---

### 1. Data reshaping

** Why would you reshape? **

One reason to reshape is to get data in a proper 'tidy' format.

The broader reason is that data can be in multiple shapes and you may need different ones for different purposes.

'Tidy' data doesn't always fully determine what you should do, particularly in the case of repeated measures data.

---

### 1. Data reshaping

** How do you reshape? **

The `tidyr` package offers the `gather()` and `spread()` functions.

These are meant to be replaced by the "pivot" functions from `dplyr`, which are `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`


---

### 1. Data reshaping

** How do you reshape? **

### 2. Data joining

**What are joins?**

Why are joins important?

What are the different types?

How do we know we're doing them right?

---

### 2. Data joining

**What are joins?**

- When you have multiple data frames that you want to combine
- Need to have overlap

Why are joins important?
- They are the way we will use to integrate data from different sources for analysis
- Doing them incorrectly can substantially change your data set

---


### 2. Data joining

**Different types of joins**

* Main types
  + left join
  + right join 
  + full join
  + inner join

* Less common 
  + semi join
  + anti join

---

### 2. Data joining

`dplyr::left_join()`

* Columns from both
* Matching rows from both
* non-matching rows from X only
![Join gif](img/left-join.gif)


---

### 2. Data joining

`dplyr::right_join()`

* Columns from both
* Matching rows from both
* non-matching rows from Y only
![Join gif](img/right-join.gif)
---

### 2. Data joining

`dplyr::full_join()`

* Columns from both
* Matching rows from both
* non-matching rows from both
![Join gif](img/full-join.gif)

---

### 2. Data joining

`dplyr::inner_join()`

* Columns from both
* Matching rows from both
* non-matching rows from neither
![Join gif](img/inner-join.gif)

---

### 2. Data joining

`dplyr::semi_join()`

* Columns from X
* Matching rows from both
* non-matching rows from neither
![Join gif](img/semi-join.gif)

---

### 2. Data joining

`dplyr::anti_join()`

* Columns from X
* No matching rows 
* Only non-matching rows from X
![Join gif](img/anti-join.gif)
---

### 2. Data joining

How do we know we're doing them right?
- Short answer: Carefully inspecting your data before and after

How do we know which one to choose?
- Short answer: Knowing what the different types do and knowing your data
- It all depends on what you want.

---

### 2. Data joining

Matching variables: 
* Need to make sure matching variables are correct
* Join functions by default will match all names, but you can specify

Need to align variable names:
* Can do this by renaming variables 
* Can also specify corresponding pairs in the join functions

Other issues to consider: 
* Multiple matches
* Matching NAs
* Duplicate variable labels

---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summary

** How do we look at summary information about our variables? **

What do we mean by grouping?

How do we group?

What can you do with grouped data?

---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summary

** How do we look at summary information about our data? **

`summarize()` from `dplyr` allows us to look at various sorts of summary info.

---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summary

** What do we mean by grouping? **

Grouping is when we create groups in our data based on a categorical variable (or something that can be transformed into one).


---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summary

** How do we group? **

The `dplyr` function `group_by()` allows us to create grouped data frames.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

storms %>% 
  group_by(name)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  head(5)
```

---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summaries

** What can we do with grouped data? **

We can combine `summarize()` with grouped data frames and get summary information by group.

We can also do different sorts of data cleaning operations on grouped data.

---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summaries

** Finding the mean wind speed for storms **

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wind_speed = mean(wind))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wind_speed = mean(wind))
```

---

### 3. Grouped data operations and summaries

** Finding the mean wind speed for storms and arranging **

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wind_speed = mean(wind)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_wind_speed))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

storms %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(mean_wind_speed = mean(wind)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_wind_speed))
```
