## Homework (12-14)

Weekly homework. To be submitted in the form of an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) via Canvas. There are a few weeks in which we may not have homework for different reasons; why the number of homeworks is listed as 12-14.

## Personal statement on data ethics

Write a personal statement on oneâ€™s perspective toward the role and nature of data, addressing how issues of equity, privacy, and ethics are central to data science in education (due approximately one-third of the way through the semester).
