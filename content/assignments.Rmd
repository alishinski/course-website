## Homework (12-14)

Weekly homework. To be submitted in the form of an R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) via Canvas. There are a few weeks in which we may not have homework for different reasons; why the number of homeworks is listed as 12-14.

## Individual final project

Complete an individually-designed project that can take different forms (R Markdown Report, interactive Shiny app, interactive dashboard, etc.) related to identifying and solving a data-related problem in education using R (due approximately two-thirds of the way through the semester).
