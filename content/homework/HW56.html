<h1>Background</h1>
<p>For this homework, we will be covering material from the last 2 weeks of data visualization.</p>
</div>
<div id="background-part-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Background Part 1</h1>
<p>We will use a built in dataset for part 1 this week’s homework, called <code>mpg</code>. It
contains fuel economy and other data on 38 models of cars. You can learn more
about it by typing this in the console <code>?mpg</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Loading data</h1>
<p>To load the data, run the following code chunk.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.5     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
## ✓ tibble  3.1.3     ✓ dplyr   1.0.6
## ✓ tidyr   1.1.3     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
## ✓ readr   1.4.0     ✓ forcats 0.5.1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>data(mpg)</code></pre>
<p>Once you’ve loaded it, familiarize yourself with the different variables in the
dataset using the methods that we’ve talked about.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-the-count-function" class="section level1">
<h1>Using the <code>count()</code> function</h1>
<p>The <code>count()</code> function can be a useful way to
summarize data for plotting. Here’s an example of how this works:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mpg %&gt;% count(year)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 2
##    year     n
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1  1999   117
## 2  2008   117</code></pre>
<p>Below, I would like you to create a barplot showing the number of vehicles per
manufacturer, using the <code>count()</code> function and <code>geom_col()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="plotting-summary-statistics" class="section level1">
<h1>Plotting summary statistics</h1>
<p>As we discussed in class, the combination of <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code> can
be used to generate summary dataframes which you can then use to plot summary
statistics. Below, we would like you to generate a summary dataframe and plot
the summary statistics you create. You can use whatever variables from the data
you see fit. Refer back to the slides and video from this week’s (and last
week’s) class for examples of how to do this if you’re not sure.</p>
</div>
<div id="tell-a-story" class="section level1">
<h1>Tell a story</h1>
<p>As I mentioned in one class, one important principle of creating data
visualizations is using them to tell a clear story about some aspect of the
data. I would like you to tell me something interesting about the data. By
interesting I don’t mean it has to be anything earth-shattering, but just a
coherent conclusion about the data that is communicated by your plot. Make it
look nice insofar as it serves this end, but there’s no need to go overboard.
For more about what we mean by tell a story, I will refer you to one of the readings
for this week, which shows some examples of storytelling with the mpg dataset:
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html" class="uri">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html</a>
Of course I would like your story to be different from the examples in that
chapter. Be creative and have fun with it!</p>
</div>
<div id="background-part-2" class="section level1">
<h1>Background Part 2</h1>
<p>We will use a data set built into dplyr for part 2 of this week’s homework.
The data, which we have encountered before,
“includes the positions and attributes of 198 tropical storms, measured every six
hours during the lifetime of a storm.”</p>
<p>Like for the <code>mpg</code> data set, you can learn more about it by typing
this in the console <code>?storms</code>. Note that the back tick marks are simply to format
code in R Markdown - you do not include these when you run the code.</p>
<p>Note how this appears differently in output; in fact, since Slack allows us to
use Markdown, you can also use back ticks like this to format code in Slack!).</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-data-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Loading data</h1>
<p>To load the data, in the next code chunk, load the tidyverse package and then type
storms to load and view the storms data from the dplyr package that is loaded as a
part of the tidyverse:</p>
<p>Once you’ve loaded it, familiarize yourself with the different variables in the
data set using the methods for inspecting and exploring a new data set we have
discussed.</p>
<p>Next, filter the data to include observations only from 2006 (including that year)
through the last year with data available in the data, and save the results back
to a new object to use for the remainder of this homework.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-color" class="section level1">
<h1>Using Color</h1>
<p>First, create a plot using pressure and wind on the x- and y- axes (which axis
corresponds to which is you choice)! Use geom_point() in this plot.</p>
<p><strong>Assigning a color to a geom</strong></p>
<p>Next, assign a color to the points by adding to the code above.</p>
<p>To see a list of available colors in R, type <code>colors()</code> in the console. You can also consult this resource: <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter" class="uri">http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a></p>
<p>If helpful, check out this last week’s slides for a tip:
<a href="https://f21-intro-to-data-sci-methods-in-ed.netlify.app/slides/week7-slides.html" class="uri">https://f21-intro-to-data-sci-methods-in-ed.netlify.app/slides/week7-slides.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Mapping a color scale to a variable</strong></p>
<p>Next, map a color scale to a variable. This is different from assigning a color
to points; instead, the use of color should be used to represent different values
of a variable.</p>
<p>Choose which variable you would like to represent with a color scale. For a tip,
consult this week’s slides (linked above).</p>
<p><strong>Changing the color scale</strong></p>
<p>Next, change the color scale. Recall the function we demonstrated in our slides
for easily changing the color scale (hint: it includes the term “brewer”). In your
use of this function, consider whether the specific color scale you are using is:</p>
<ul>
<li>sequential,</li>
<li>diverging, or</li>
<li>qualitative</li>
</ul>
<p>And, specify the correct scale for the variable you are representing corresponds
to the variable you wish to represent. Finally, once you have settled on the type of
color scale you are using, consider changing the color palette; view the help documentation
(or the slides) for tips on how to do that. Feel free to play around with what
variable you represent, what scale you use, and what palette you use!</p>
</div>
<div id="stacking-and-dodging-bars" class="section level1">
<h1>Stacking and dodging bars</h1>
<p>By default, the geom we use for bar/column charts, <code>geom_col()</code>, “stacks” the bars
vertically.</p>
<p>First, run the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>storms %&gt;% 
  group_by(year) %&gt;% 
  summarize(mean_wind = mean(wind))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 41 × 2
##     year mean_wind
##    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1  1975      50.9
##  2  1976      59.9
##  3  1977      54.0
##  4  1978      40.5
##  5  1979      48.7
##  6  1980      53.7
##  7  1981      56.6
##  8  1982      49.5
##  9  1983      47.0
## 10  1984      51.4
## # … with 31 more rows</code></pre>
<p>What do you notice? Add a note about below:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, replace year in the code above with status, and run the new code:</p>
<p>What do you notice now? Add a note about this below:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, group by both year and status; add both to your <code>group_by</code> function.</p>
<p>If you need a tip regarding how to group by multiple variables, check the code
used in some of the slides, or the help documentation (by running <code>?group_by()</code>
in the console.</p>
<p>What do you notice now? Add one last note:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plotting the mean wind speeds</strong></p>
<p>Next, plot the mean wind speeds, using the code you wrote above as the
foundation. Specifically, using ggplot2, assign the x-axis values to the year,
and the y-axis values to the variable you calculated for the mean wind speed.
Finally, specify that the fill aesthetic is equal to the location variable; see
the slides for an example of using the fill aesthetic.</p>
<p>Finally, dodge the plots by year. To do so, add an argument to dodge the columns
to the <code>geom_col()</code> function you used; our slides have an example that might help
you to do this:</p>
</div>
<div id="faceting-plots" class="section level1">
<h1>Faceting plots</h1>
<p>Above, beneath the bold text <strong>Changing the color scale</strong>, you created a scatter plot
that involved mapping a color to a variable and changing the scale to be appropriate
for the variable you chose.</p>
<p>Below, copy and paste the final code you used. Add to that code a layer that will
facet the plots based upon the year. An example of how to do this is available in
the section of the slides corresponding to faceting plots. Depending on what variable
you mapped to a color, you may need to tinker with your plot (and the variables you
included in it) for this plot to make sense. Tinkering and modifications, including
to theme elements, are welcome.</p>
