<p>We are going to update our shiny app from the last 2 homeworks!</p>
<p>We will build upon our regression modeler app by adding some new features using the new stuff we’ve learned.</p>
<p>The instructions are essentially the same as last time. This file contains the instructions for the homework, and you will use the app.R file you created last time. Then, to submit this homework, please submit the app.R shiny file on slack, as you would normally do with the .Rmd file. Then put in your information about your app at the bottom of this file, render to html, and submit that to canvas as you normally would.</p>
</div>
<div id="requirements" class="section level1">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>To the user interface you will add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing, unless you want to</li>
</ul>
<p>To the server code you will add:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A modal dialog button that confirms the model fitting step initiated by the action button (the action button should trigger the modal, and the confirm button on the modal dialog should fit the model)</p></li>
<li><p>A notification that shows up after the model has been fit indicating that it was successful</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve demo-ed these features in class so please refer back to the class recordings if you are having problems, or please feel free to ask any question that comes up on slack.</p>
</div>
<div id="instructions" class="section level1">
