# Individual Final Project

### Overview

Complete an individually-designed project that can take different forms (R Markdown Report, interactive Shiny app, interactive dashboard, etc.) related to identifying and solving a data-related problem in education using R. 

### Details

The scope of the project must involve making substantial progress toward a research-related goal.

These goals can take a number of different forms, including:

- Accessing, cleaning, and initially describing the dimensions of a new data source (e.g., data from Twitter)
- Analyzing data in a new way and writing the results up in a brief report
- Analyzing an existing data set that you have in ways that would be difficult to do without some of the techniques in this class/without the sue of R
- Creating an interactive data visualization or dashboard
- ... (let's discuss your ideas!)

I ame more focused on the process you take than the specifics of your project, as I discuss next.

### Process and Timeline and Due Dates

A draft is due approximately two-thirds of the way through the semester, and your final project is due in presentation (screen recording via Zoom) form at the very end of the semester.

**Stage 1**
- Initial ideas posted in a class-wide Google Slides presentation, 10/12; do so here: (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1etv_oXeSjn8YdgZFHzPrAM4RRESXiEDFkdmodnNW1Mo/edit#slide=id.gf8d5e65320_2_5)
- You will provide feedback to peers (by 10/14)
  
**Stage 2**

In this stage, you will revised and expand upon the final project ideas you detailed in the Google Slides presentation (see Stage 1 above for a link to the presentation). To do this, you will create and share your own Google Doc. 

First, create a Google Doc. In this document, please add information on the following elements.

You may copy this over with the prompts if you would like, replacing the instructions following each colon:

*Title*: A tentative title for your final project - consider something memorable that also accurately describes the goal of your project

*Overview*: One paragraph on what topic, question, or problem you are considering working on for your final project. As a starter, consider including within this paragraph a sentence to establish why you are pursuing the topic, question, or problem you are for your final project.

Depending on the specifics of your project, specify either (or both) the substantive (e.g., why might what you are doing be important / of interest to others) and/or technical (e.g., what you'll be learning and doing) parts of your project.

*Data*: One paragraph on the data you plan or hope to use: Its source, dimensions, technical information about what format(s) it is in, and what parts/subsets (if relevant) you might use.

*Product*: What form(s) will your final project take? Our baseline assumption is that you will share an 
R Markdown report with the code and output of your code, but, there are additions you can make to this, as 
well as entirely different products that you can create. Examples of other products include specific figures, 
hosting the R Markdown report on your own website and/or on [R Pubs](https://rpubs.com/), creating a dashboard or an interactive Shiny web application, creating an R script, starting an APA-formatted manuscript, etc. (the sky is the limit!)

*Major Goals / Milestones*: In a bullet-point list, describes the major goals / milestones for your project. Most projects will include between 3-5 of these. 

For instance, for a project that involves creating a map of the locations of users' social media accounts, these might be goals / milestones such as: 

* obtain permission to use the data and obtain the data from collaborators or mentors
* read the data into R and prepare and clean the data for subsequent analyses
* determine the locations of individuals using XXX method
* create a map using a relevant package with R
* save the plot in a high-resolution image and share the code and plot in an R Markdown document to enhance the reproducibility of the analysis/to prepare for future changes to the map going forward.

*Key questions and / or concerns*: Add bullet points with any key questions and / or concerns that you have. In this, identify specific gaps where you don't know how to complete a goal / milestone (those you detailed above) or where you don't know what the step is.

**Stage 3**
- Final project
  - Submission of a product (likely a rendered `.Rmd` file, but possibly something) and a five-ten minute recording of your work; why you chose to work on this, what you did, and what you want to do next, DEADLINE FORTHCOMING - _strict deadline_
    - In your five-ten minute recording, please describe:
      - The topic of your project
      - Why you chose this topic - what problem it solve or question it helped/helps you to answer
      - What you did, including the learning/independent work you had to do to be able to achieve what you did
      - What you are most proud of about your final project
      - What you still want to know more about/what you want to do next having completed your final project
    - I recommend using Zoom and recording to the Cloud - then using that link to share your recording (more details below)

### Other resources

Available data sets:

- Your own!
- Education data package: https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r
- Data from Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research
- Data from Facebook: https://help.crowdtangle.com/en/articles/4302208-crowdtangle-for-academics-and-researchers
- Other ideas for data sets?

### How to submit

- **Final Product** Please submit _an HTML file_ for this assignment on Canvas. If you used a different format (other than Rmd), you may submit a relevant product (e.g., an attachment or a link to a Shiny app).
- **Recording**: 
  - Share the link to your recording in the #final-projects channel.
  - Please also share the product (the .Rmd version if you used R Markdown, or whatever format your final project took)
  - Also, _you will share your recording with the members of your base group_
