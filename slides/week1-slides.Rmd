## Course FAQ

**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics $\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

# Over-arching design

The pedagogical framework *plays out* in the following specific ways:

1. You'll first hear about the concepts underlying what you can do 
1. You'll see examples of working out these ideas in practice
1. You'll try these ideas out on your own

---

# An argument for this class

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use R and RStudio to solve
problems that are important to you**

- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education**

---

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is increasingly used in education
* It can help you to carry out your educational analyses in open and trustworthy ways
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

---

# RMarkdown

* RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
* It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
* It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)

# Let's look at a bit of code together

What do you think this code will do?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sci_mo_processed %>% 
  filter(percentage_earned >= .60) %>% 
  select(student_id, course_id, percentage_earned))
```
