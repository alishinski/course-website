### Review of last week's class

**Last week we discussed wrangling and tidying data**:

1. Reshaping data
  - `pivot_wide()` and `pivot_long()`
2. Joining data
  - `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, and others
3. Grouped data operations with dplyr
  - `group_by()` and `summarize()`

---

### Review of last week's class

**Reading**

* From R for Data Science: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html
* tidy data:
  * every variable has its own column
  * every observation has its own row
  * every value has its own cell

* tidy data makes it easier to use similar tools (even with very different datasets and types of data)
* tidy data works well with R

### Review of last week's class

*TB cases*

- Where is the year variable represented?
- Where is the cases variable represented?
- How many observations does each row represent?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table4a
```

### This week's topics

**Overview**

1. Introduction to data viz
2. A bit more tidying data

We are by no means done with the data tidying functions we discussed last week!

### 1. Intro to Data Viz

**Outline**

A. Why visualize data?  
B. How can we visualize data in R?  
C. And, how can we make our visualizations aesthetically pleasing?  

---

### 1A: Why visualize data?

One answer: 

"You should look at your data." ([Healy, 2018](https://socviz.co/))

*To elaborate on this*:

- Visualizations allow to _understand the structure and nature of your data_, and to begin to understand what might relate to what else
- Just like we want to be constantly looking at our data in its spreadsheet/table/data frame format (e.g., `str()`, `glimpse()`, and `View()`), visualizing our data can help us to make sure our data contains what we think it does-and it can alert us to when it does not

---

### 1A: Why visualize data?

These four different data sets have the same correlation (type `anscombe` in R to view the data), but are very different

```{r, out.width = "65%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://socviz.co/dataviz-pdfl_files/figure-html4/ch-01-anscombe-1.png")
```

---

### 1A: Why visualize data

Another reason to visualize data is to *communicate with others*; you can use visualizations to communicate your findings or results. In example:

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides_files/figure-html/bar1-1.png")
```
---

```{r, out.width = "75%", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides_files/figure-html/bar8-1.png")
```

### 1B: How to visualize data

One way to think about visualizing data is in terms of the _type_ of visualization you create:

- Histogram
- Density plot
- Scatter plot
- Bar chart
- Pie chart ([gasp!](https://socviz.co/refineplots.html))
- Time series plot/line chart

---

### 1B: How to visualize data

Another way to think about visualizing data is in terms of the elements that make up a plot.

The *grammar of graphics* ([Wickham, 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098), [Wilkinson, 2012](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21551-3_13)) has a particular answer to the question of what a plot includes:

Why a grammar of graphics?

- gain insight into complex figures
- reveal deeper relationships between what may appear to be unrelated visualizations
- more flexibly and creatively visualize data--including in ways that do not fit well into one type of plot
- suggest what makes a good figure

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

One view of visualizations is that they consist of four components:

1. Data
2. One or more geometric objects (shape, point, line, etc.)
3. A mapping between variables in the data and the geometric objects and their characteristics (including their size and color)
4. A theme

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

Let's see how this might appear:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# create a dataset
data <- data.frame(
  name=c( rep("Question 1",500), rep("Question 2",500), rep("Question 3",500), rep("Question 4",20), rep('Question 5', 100)  ),
  value=c( rnorm(500, 3, 1), rnorm(500, 2, .5), rnorm(500, 3.1, 1), rnorm(20, 4, 2), rnorm(100, 6, 1.5) )
) %>% 
  filter(value > 0) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

```{r}
data
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

### 1B: How to visualize data

- The previous slide contained a potentially _useful_ plot
- However, we might be able to improve both its interpretability and its aesthetic


```{r, out.width="62%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/21d683072b0c21cbd9b41fc0e37a587ad26b9525/cbf41/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/data-visualization-2.1.png")
```

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point()
```

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter()
```

---

### 1B: How to visualize data

You can create different plots by:

- Changing the aesthetic _mapping_ between variables in the data and geometric objects
- Changing the geometric objects

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = name, color = name)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter()
```

---

### 1B: How to visualize data?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = name, fill = name)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "gray") +
  geom_violin()
```

---

### 1C: How to make visualizations aesthetically pleasing

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = name, fill = name)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "gray") +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

_Theming and fine-tuning_

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = name, fill = name)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "gray") +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer("", type = "qual") +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Times"),
        legend.position = "none") +
  ggtitle("Distributions for the Five Questions")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = name, fill = name)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "gray") +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer("", type = "qual") +
  ylab(NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Times"),
        legend.position = "none") +
  ggtitle("Distributions for the Five Questions")
```

### 2: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

Often, we have to make changes to our data frame in order to create the visualization we would like to create.

---

### 2: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

**Making a new variable prior to plotting the data**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pred_frame %>% 
  mutate(isTeacher = ifelse(isTeacher == 0, "Non-Teachers", "Teachers")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year_of_post_centered + 2016, prediction)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = type_of_tweet), 
            size = 1.3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = label, color = type_of_tweet),
           family = "Times New Roman",
           data = label_frame) +
  facet_wrap(~isTeacher, ncol = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year", breaks = seq(2010, 2020, 2)) +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Standardized Model-Predicted Sentiment Score")
```

### 2: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

```{r, out.width="60%", echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/interactions.png")
```

---

### 2: How does tidying data relate to data viz?

_Other data tidying steps_ we might take prior to visualizing data:

  - **recoding** variables
  - **creating a factor** (so that we can order elements of a plot as we wish for them
  to be ordered)
  - **grouping** and **summarizing** to plot a summary statistic
  - realizing that your data processing and tidying was not quite sufficient,
  so **returning to those stages** before finalizing your visualization
  - **re-running our analysis** (`.Rmd` file) because we discovered an issue with our 
  data

- _Also_, in GIF form (type `/giphy` in Slack, and then a random term), summarize how you are feeling
about R
