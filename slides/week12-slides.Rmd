# Welcome!

Welcome to *week 13*!

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%"}

# Discussion!

- What is something about R you've learned working on your final project that goes beyond what we've covered in class?

---

## A recap of last week (on functional programming)

- R has built in functions from packages, but you can write your own too!

- The purrr package offers tools to do multiple iterations of operations

---

## Chunk options

*For a single chunk*:

- eval = FALSE
- echo = FALSE
- warning = FALSE
- message = FALSE

*For the entire document*:

- knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

### Topics for today

**Record the meeting** 

A. Continued discussion on purrr - Iteration (or, _applying_ functions)

B. Introduction to missing data procedures with MICE 

---

### A. Iteration

Iteration is another name for your computer carrying out some step(s) multiple times.

Iteration is helpful when, even after writing a function, you find yourself copying and pasting the same code (with modifications)

---

### A. Iteration

Iteration can be helpful when you want to apply a function multiple times.

The map functions can help with this. There are different ones based on the type of object returned.

The key to understanding (and writing) functions is understanding what kind of input they take and what kind of output they return.

`map()` - Applies function to every element of a list and return a list
`map2()` - Applies function to every element from 2 lists and return a list

Lists are ordered collections of any other type of object. You can have a list of vectors, a list of data frames, and a list of different types of objects. 

`map_chr()` - returns a char vector of objects created
`map_dbl()` - returns a numeric vector of objects created
`map_dfc()` - objects created become columns of data frame
`map_dfr()` - objects created become rows of a data frame

### A. Iteration

Example: COVID vaccine data

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><b><p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna <a href="https://t.co/P1fTcCEoTP">pic.twitter.com/P1fTcCEoTP</a></p></b>

---

### A. Iteration

Example: COVID vaccine data - Read in the data

One way to load data:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
pfi <- read_csv(here("data", "COVID", "COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_Pfizer.csv"))
mod <- read_csv(here("data", "COVID", "COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_Moderna.csv"))
jan <- read_csv(here("data", "COVID", "COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_Janssen.csv"))
jan
```

---

### A. Iteration

Example: COVID vaccine data - Read in the data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vaccines <- c("Pfizer", "Moderna", "Janssen")
file_base <- "/COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_"
file_ext <- ".csv"

file_names <- str_c(here("content", "data", "COVID"), file_base, vaccines, file_ext)

vax_files <- file_names %>% map(read_csv)
names(vax_files) <- vaccines
vax_files
```


---

### A. Iteration

Example: COVID vaccine data - Rename the data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# write my rename function
rename_vaccine_data <- function(dat){
  dat <- dat %>% rename("State" = "Jurisdiction",
                 "Week" = "Week of Allocations",
                 "First Dose" = "1st Dose Allocations",
                 "Second Dose" = "2nd Dose Allocations")
  dat
}

# map it to every data set in the list
vax_files %>% map(rename_vaccine_data)
```

Error: Can't rename columns that don't exist. x Column `2nd Dose Allocations` doesn't exist.

---

### A. Iteration

Example: COVID vaccine data - Rename the data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rename_vaccine_data <- function(dat){
  if(ncol(dat) == 4){
    dat <- dat %>% rename("State" = "Jurisdiction",
                          "Week" = "Week of Allocations",
                          "First Dose" = "1st Dose Allocations",
                          "Second Dose" = "2nd Dose Allocations")
    dat
  } else {
    dat <- dat %>% rename("State" = "Jurisdiction",
                          "Week" = "Week of Allocations",
                          "First Dose" = "1st Dose Allocations")
    dat
  }

}

vax_files <- vax_files %>% map(rename_vaccine_data)
vax_files$Pfizer
```

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

`lm()` default way of dealing with missing data: listwise deletion

Better way to deal with missing data: imputation

Basic idea:

If data missing, you can fill in values that let you estimate your model on whole data

Good: Mean imputation

Better: Model based imputation

Best: Multiple imputation

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: Multiple Imputation using Chained Equations

Dealing with missing data is a big idea, and the nuances can be tricky

Our goal is to show you that you need not be intimidated by approaching this task in R

If you are doing inferential models in your analyses, MI is a tool that should be in your toolkit

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

Example: Regression model

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ug_data <- read_csv(here("content", "data", "undergrad_data.csv"))

vis_dat(ug_data)

na.omit(ug_data)
```

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

Example: Regression model

```{r}
fit <- lm(PROJ_TOTAL ~ Prob_solve_pre + extraversion + agreeableness + conscient. + stability + openness  + Metacog. + SelfEfficacy + IntGoalOrient + ExtGoalOrient, 
          data = ug_data)
```

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

Example: Regression model

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: viewing missing data pattern

```{r}
library(mice)

md.pattern(ug_data)
```

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: Generating imputed data sets with `mice()`

```{r}
ug_data_imp <- mice(ug_data, m = 5)
```

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: Examining missing data

```{r}
ug_data_imp$imp$SelfEfficacy
```


---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: Extracting data sets with `complete()`

```{r}
comp_data <- complete(ug_data_imp, 2)
comp_data
```


---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: fitting models with `with()`

```{r}
fit_imp <- with(data = ug_data_imp, exp = lm( PROJ_TOTAL ~ Prob_solve_pre + extraversion + agreeableness + conscient. + stability + openness  + Metacog. + SelfEfficacy + IntGoalOrient + ExtGoalOrient))
fit_imp
```

---

### B. Multiple Imputation of missing data with MICE

The MICE package: pooling output with `pool()`

```{r}
summary(pool(fit_imp))
broom::tidy(fit)
```
